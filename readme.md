## Dependency Management

The project binaries are available in Maven Central.  Just add the following to your maven configuration or tailor to your own dependency management system.

[Please refer to the Migration Guide when upgrading from 2.5.1 to 3.0.0+](https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/wiki/Migration-Guide)

For Maven: 

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.javaparser</groupId>
    <artifactId>javaparser-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.5.11</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle:

```
compile 'com.github.javaparser:javaparser-core:3.5.11'
```

## How To Compile Sources

If you checked out the project from GitHub you can build the project with maven using:

```
mvn clean install
```

If you checkout the sources and want to view the project in an IDE, it is best to first generate some of the source files; otherwise you will get many compilation complaints in the IDE. (mvn clean install already does this for you.)

```
mvn javacc:javacc
```

If you modify the code of the AST nodes, specifically if you add or remove fields or node classes,
the code generators will update a lot of code for you.
The `run_metamodel_generator.sh` script will rebuild the metamodel,
which is used by the code generators which are run by `run_core_generators.sh`
Make sure that `javaparser-core` at least compiles before you run these.
